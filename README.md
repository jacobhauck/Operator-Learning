# Operator Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains simple, unified implementations of popular
operator learning models, such as

- DeepONet
- Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)
- More in the future!

## What is Operator Learning?

## Important Implementation Concepts

Here we outline the important concepts underlying our implementations
of operator learning models, which are crucial for increasing
simplicity, unity and flexibility.

### Functions

In operator learning the primary data objects are *functions*; this
is in contrast to machine learning, where the data consists of tensors.
